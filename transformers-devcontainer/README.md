# Llama Devcontainer
This project includes a Dockerfile to build a development container that can be used along with VSCode to establish a repeatable environment
from which to experiment with LLama2, streamlit, and the IntelÂ® Extension for PyTorch\*

## Installation
Use the script `build_dev_container` in the parent directory to quickly build the container image locally.  The `.devcontainer` folder and `devcontainer.json`
file in the parent project will automatically connect VSCode to the development container.
